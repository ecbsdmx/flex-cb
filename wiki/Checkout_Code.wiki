= Introduction =

Since it is sometime difficult to figure out how to checkout code and commit changes back to a Google Project, here is a little recipe on how to get connected!


= Configuration =

1) Create a Google account if you don't already have one by clicking here: https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount

2) Ask an administrator (Xavier!) to add you to the project.


== Option 1: Subclipse ==

3) Install Subclipse (http://subclipse.tigris.org/), the Subversion plugin for Eclipse (www.eclipse.org).

4) In Eclipse, select *Windows* | *Preferences*. Then, on the left, go to _General_ | _Network Connections_. Enter your proxy configuration than click _OK_.
