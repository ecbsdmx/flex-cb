The purpose of this project is to create useful visualizations of statistical data from institutions that employ SDMX. A starting point is to reuse the ADOBE FLEX source code already developed by the ECB, kick starting productivity and reducing duplication of effort.

One of the key goals of the project is to collaboratively make improvements to the flex visualizations that may include: improved interoperability with different data sets (real time, calculators output etc...) and improved information support for an expanded user base; and a new channel for interested parties to collaborate and share code with each other and the community (read open CVS); and an improved presentation layer.

A more general purpose is to advance the creation, evolution, promotion, and support of this source code while cultivating an ecosystem of complementary products, capabilities, and services.
